"M[k]=n" means we select the number which is nth smaller in remaining value.

So,
M[9] : 3 // first digit is 2 because 2 is third number in ascending order
M[8] : 7 // 2 is used in M[9]. So, 7 is 7th number in ascending order
M[7] : 7
M[6] : 3
M[5] : 6
M[4] : 2
M[3] : 3
M[2] : 2
M[1] : 2

means 2783915460
